### Client: Studiolekker | Thompson Reuters
A showcase for Thompson Reuters to present a collection of “Reuters Firsts” _( stories that Reuters broke first )_. The site allows user to view stories by regions, categories, and dynamic search capability. Users can search articles by date, region, category, and country.

The site is driven by a CakePHP admin which also featured publish/preview functionality. While the entire site is dynamic, it remains extremely responsive using page caching to lighten the server overhead. The server cache only gets flushed when the cms is published.
