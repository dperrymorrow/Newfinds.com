Hi I am David Morrow, Javascript / Ruby On Rails developer. I live in Portland, Oregon. I like building rich clients on Ruby On Rails enpoints. 

I often work with Backbone.js and have build rather complicated single page applications with it. I am a competent Rails developer, and can accomplish most common tasks with Rails the right way. 

I use Test Driven Development whenever possible. I test all my Javascript code with either Jasmine or QUnit. I like HAML, SASS, and have use Coffeescript extensivly in the past. I am currently however enjoying writing raw Javascript as it keeps me better in touch with the language I am ultimately writing for.

I hate know-it-alls. Im a formally trained graphic designer. _(no those two statements are not inherently opposing :)_

If you think I would be a good fit for your project please contact me via one of the methods below.  
Happy developing, Dave
