### To Install The Spark
From terminal, you must have sparks installed prior, see [sparks page](http://newfinds.com/code-igniter-sparks) for instructions.

    [bash]
	cd /path_to_your_CI_reactor_build
	php tools/spark install tracer



### Example Usage: ( x.x indicates the version you have installed on your build )
    
    // from a controller 
	
	function index(){
		$this->load->spark( 'tracer/x.x' );
		// keep on rendering page if false ( default )
		trace( $_SERVER, FALSE );
		// exit php and rendering if true
		trace( $_SERVER, TRUE );
	}
	
	
### To Trace Out All View Vars
You can also trace out everything that was passed to your view. This must be called after you load view and pass data via 

    $this->load->view( 'viewname', $data ); 
    // See  http://codeigniter.com/user_guide/libraries/loader.html for more information on views and data.
    trace_viewdata( TRUE ); // will exit if true, no if false

Thats it!!
