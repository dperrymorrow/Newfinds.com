teaser: Convert any Backbone.js class into a singleton.

content:
Ever wanna have a backbone singleton class? Allowing you to access a classes instance from anywhere without having to pass around a handle to an instance.

## The additional backbone class
    
    [javascript]
     Backbone.Singleton = {
       getInstance: function () {
         if (this._instance === undefined) {
           this._instance = new this();
         }
         return this._instance;
       }
     }

## Example usage with a Backbone.Router
    
    [javascript]
    TestRouter = function(){};
    _.extend( TestRouter, Backbone.Router );
    // extend Backbone.Singleton
    _.extend( TestRouter, Backbone.Singleton );
    // access your router from anywhere!!
    // just make sure not to call new, 
    // only use .getInstance()
    var inst = TestRouter.getInstance();

I have a fork of Backbone.js with this code addition and tests on github.
