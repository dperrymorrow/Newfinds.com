### Git, yeah it's cool and not just another trend.

If you haven't used Git for your version control yet, you should. I resisted for a while thinking that nothing is wrong with Subversion. But after trying Git because of Sparks, I now see that its not just yet another stupid programming trend. Anyhow, that's my opinion, but if you want to use Git, these commands will get you up and running.

### My Git Cheat Sheet
All the following commands are run after you cd into the directory your build is in.  
In my case
    
    [bash]
    cd /Applications/mamp/htdocs/name_of_project

build a git repo in a directory _initializes the project as a git repo_

    [bash]
    git init

Add a file or folder

    [bash]
    git add [yourfilename]

Commit all changed files in the directory

    [bash]
    git commit -a -m "your commit message"

Add your remote origin _remote origin is where the files go on push example: github_

    [bash]
    git remote add origin git@github.com:[username]/[Repo-Name].git

Push commits to the remote repo

    [bash]
    git push -u origin master

Add a version number

    [bash]
    git tag 1.0

Push your tag to the remote repository

    [bash]
    git push --tags

Thats it for basic usage, if you're like me that will keep you going for the first few days. But then i got a pull request on one of my repos so i had to figure that out then.

### Merging Pull Requests

    [bash]
    git checkout master
    git remote add [username] git://github.com/[username]/jobs.git
    git fetch [username]
    git merge [commit #]
    git push origin master

### Git clients

I will probably get a Git client here before too long but for now im doing ok with the terminal. I hear good things about [Git Tower](http://www.git-tower.com/) and may purchase it.
