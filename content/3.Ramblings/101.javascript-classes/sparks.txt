### So How do you make a Javascript class?

If you are like me when I first started using Javascript I was confused as to how to make a class. There are no classes or package declarations like there is in Actionscript. Turns out its pretty simple, lets take a look.

### Making a Javascript class that you can instantiate.

    [javascript]
    function MainClass( param1, param2 ){

		this.param1 = param1;
		this.param2 = param2;
		
		this.build = function(){
			/*
			* treat this as your constructor
			* does not need to be build, can name anything you would like
			*/
		}
		
		this.doSomething( param ){
			// an example of a method
		}
		
		this.build();
	}
	
### Build your singleton class

    [javascript]
    var Singleton = {};

	Singleton.doSomething = function(){
		/*
		* your method that can be accessed from anywhere
		*/
	}
	
### Now you can access the class from anywhere.

    [javascript]
    Singleton.doSomething();
