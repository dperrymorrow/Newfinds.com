content: 
A simple mobile web site that I created when I was learning guitar. As you type it shows you all the related chord fingering charts. It came in pretty handy on my I-Touch when I was learning new chords. 

The workings of are very simple, its all static with a list of images with tag names that I search relevance with jQuery selectors.
