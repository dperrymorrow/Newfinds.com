Inspired by [Jsbin](http://jsbin.com/), I wanted to do the equivalent for CSS. I find it frustrating to write CSS, alt+tab refresh, alt+tab back to editor, repeat all day long. So I mocked up Cssizer. It lets you put in html markup in one pane, and then write your styles in another and the preview *updates as you type!*. 

There are many features I want to add like...

- Pulling in css libraries via drop down like Jsbin does with JS
- Ability to pick the hash key
- And I'm sure ill think of more
