content: 
I'm and avid bonsai enthusiast, _(yeah I know its weird but we all have our hobbies)_. Unfortunately eBay is full of crap as far as bonsai goes, so I teamed up with my bonsai instructor to make this alternative for a place for folks to buy and sell bonsai stuff. It works off Pay-pal tokens that you credit to your account. 

I designed this site as well as built it by myself in spare time. I used CodeIgniter as the framework on this project, and its what really got me hooked on CodeIgniter and haven't looked back since as far as frameworks go.

The hardest part of the project was dealing with Pay-pal. God their api sucks...
