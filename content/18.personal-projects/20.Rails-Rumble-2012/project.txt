Myself and several friends entered the Rails Rumble 2012 a contest to see what you can build in 48 hours with Rails on a Linode. We decided we wanted to leverage an API and a mashup of job boards and linkedIn connections was our choice. We took your connections from LinkedIn and found jobs at the companies of your connetions the idea being that you can find an "in" to a job.

> Whether you are activly looking for a new position, or just daydreaming about new opportunities, It's Who You Know is a resource for you to make real connections with people inside the companies that interest you. Use our tool to match the job postings you are qualified for with the people you know on LinkedIn to make the most of your social network during your job hunt. 

> It has never been more true that who you know is more important than what you know, and it has never been easier to make the connections within the companies you want to work for. With It's Who You Know, you get the inside scoop, get your foot in the door, and have recommendations in hand before the first interview. It's Who You Know is a powerful leg up in your job search. Try it today.
