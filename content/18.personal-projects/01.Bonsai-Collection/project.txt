I have done bonsai for a while now, I think over 10 years in all. I've worked with [Colin Lewis](http://colinlewisbonsai.com) as my teacher / mentor for many years when I lived in New York. Iv'e also went to his gardens to apprentice with him a couple of times for a week or so.

_Unfortunately_ I have moved alot over the past couple of years. Alot. I lived in Boulder for a year during which the majority of my collection died. They just cooked in the high desert.

_Fortunately_ I now live in Portland, OR and am working on building back up my collection. If you live in Portland, and do bonsai, I would love to meet you.
