teaser: A simple javascript class using the power of JQuery to trace out your values while working.

content: 
There are lots of debug options for javascript developers. Many do much more than this such as breakpoints and all that. But many times I find myself just needing something simple and quick to debug something or find out why something is not acting as desired.

I made this debug module when I was working on a intensive UI that I frequently needed to trace out items. Even though I had tools available to me, i found myself using alert() often which gets old very fast.

### Features Include

- Will recursively trace out objects and arrays
- Will escape html when tracing out for instance a div's innerHtml
- Fullscreen Toggle allows you to view more in depth your traces
- Can kill the tracer from further traces on the page when it becomes obtrusive
- Can completely disable the Tracer class by setting one variable. _(Helpful in killing traces on your production or staging environment for example)_

### Usage Example

     [javascript]
     $( document ).ready( function(){
		var myObj = {foobar:true, content:"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut."};
		// call the Tracer object, then trace method.
		Tracer.trace( myObj );
	});
     
### Disable Tracing

     [javascript]
	 Tracer.globalEnable = false;
