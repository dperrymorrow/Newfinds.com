### Client: Hyperquake | Warner Bros
Created a multilingual flash/xml website for The Departed Movie as a contractor for HyperQuake. Siteâ€™s key features included movie synopsis, videos, downloads and more. This was the first of several multilingual Flash sites I did for Warner Bros which I templatized with XML creating a simple markup language for the template.

Main functional points of this build were localization enabled, with dynamic video and image galleries.
