### CSS
- Why I like Sylus
  - features it has that no other have
  - json loading for vars
- @supports in css

### Vue
- ~~Vue router params~~
- ~~Vuex boilerplate base module~~
- Fetch route data Vue mixin
- Vue without a compiler
- Typical Vue webpack setup
  - sourcemap
  - webpack extends
  - multiple entry points
  - dev and prod configs

### Markdown
- Prism line highlight with github markdown

### Site work
- ~~set the scrollbar inside the content area instead of whole page to avoid double scrollbar~~
- ~~better 404 page~~
