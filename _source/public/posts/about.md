When asked to describe my skill set, and what differentiates me from other developers, I often answer with

> I'm a developer with a designerâ€™s eye. I bring a level of UI detail many developers lack.

Having been a designer previously, I feel I have a knack for building great UI, and collaborate well with designers and art direction.
I love building beautiful things. I have extensive experience with Data Visualization, dashboards, single page Javascript applications and more.

I strive for clean, tested client side Javascript, and love working full stack with node on occasion. I get the most satisfaction in programming solving complex problems with simple solutions.

When I am not working on projects or tinkering with open source. I like to backpack in the cascades, work on my bonsai collection, shop for vinyl, and play electric guitar. Oh, and of course my other full time job, being a dad.
