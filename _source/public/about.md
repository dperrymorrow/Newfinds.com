When asked to describe my skill set, and what differentiates me from other developers, I often answer with

> I'm a developer with a designerâ€™s eye. I bring a high level of detail to UI that I build.

Having started my career as a Graphic Designer, I feel I have a knack for building great UI, and collaborate well with designers and art direction. I love building well thought out UI. I have extensive experience with Data Visualization, dashboards, single page Javascript applications and more.

I strive for clean, tested client side Javascript, and love working full stack in Node on occasion. I get the most satisfaction from solving complex problems with simple solutions.

When I am not working on projects or tinkering with open source. I like to backpack in the cascades, work on my bonsai collection, shop for vinyl, and play electric guitar.
